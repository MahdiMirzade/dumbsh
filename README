dumbsh - dumb shell
===================
Your shell is dumb, make it smarter.


Description
-----------
If you have multiple layouts in your keyboard mappings, sometimes
you are typing in your second layout by mistake, like this:

	عدشپث

But you meant:

	uname

By default, your shell will not understand what you wanted to say (of
course shell is the dumb one in this situation, you're never wrong)

After installing this script, a layout table will be generated from
your second layout to your first layout, using xmodmap. (Your first
layout is english and your second layout is your other language)


Installation
------------
Enter the following command to source the dumb.sh script once you've
entered to your shell: (bash in this example)

	echo "source path/to/dumb.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

or if you're a zsh user:

	echo "source path/to/dumb.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

Restart your shell. Now when you are typing on your second layout, your
commands will be translated using the layout table which you've generated
on the first execution.

This script is supported both on zsh and bash, but if you are using
something else, you'll need to find a way to handle non-found commands
in your shell, if there is a function for it in your shell, edit the script
and add like how bash is added as a support.


Configuration
-------------
This script can be configured through environmental variables:

	DUMBSH_KEY_INDEX:
		If set, the layout table will be generated to the place
		you've set, but if not it sets to:
		$XDG_DATA_HOME/dumbsh_table
		$HOME/.local/share/dumbsh_table
	
	DUMBSH_ASK_REPLACE:
		If set to true, It'll ask before running the command,
		or else it'll Automatically run the translated command.

You can set these variables in your shell configuration/login profile in
order to config this script.
